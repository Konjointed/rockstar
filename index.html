                    <p>
                        "Sindewinder" was my introduction to the metal genre. I was working a shift Canadian Tire when I walked into the warehouse the warehouse crew was playing this song. I was immediately hooked. I love this song and the genre in general since it's very high energy and really gives a sense of <strong>POWER</strong>

                        I slide through the wasteland that's my world
                        My hunger takes your life, preyed on to keep me alive, yeah
                        Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty in me
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
                        You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        That's right I shed my skin tonight but my fangs are hard to hide
                        And you know that you're going to die, yeah
                        Mercy's all that you need, mercy's empty to me
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
                        You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control
                        That burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Making my way through the night you're still in my sight
                        You're runnin' away cause ya' know you can't hide
                        My instincts are cold blooded hate; to you I'm the bearer of fate
                        Wrong place and now the wrong time, now terror is all that you'll find
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Can't you feel the poison rising out of the morning and clear through the night
                        You can feel my strength destroy you straight to the heart from the venomous bite
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I can't regret, can't escape decisions made for me, no control
                        That burns and never dies, wrapped around I'll bury my fangs inside
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Stay inside tonight, you're out there all alone
                        Vanish from my sites, venomous control
                        You can't make it right, my appetite has grown
                        Lost your final fight, no love will be shown
                        Stay inside tonight, you're out there all alone
                        Vanish from my sites, venomous control
                        You can't make it right, my appetite has grown
